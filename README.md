## About Me

Originally, I pursued a career as a musical critic, where I honed my skills in critical analysis and attention to detail. However, I discovered my passion for coding and decided to transition to frontend development. This journey has been incredibly rewarding as I've found a new outlet for my creativity and problem-solving abilities.

I have a strong enthusiasm for front-end development and enjoy bringing designs to life with clean and efficient code. I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to tackle new challenges. My background as a musical critic has instilled in me a keen eye for aesthetics and a deep appreciation for the user experience, which I bring to every project I work on.
