## About me

Originally, I pursued a career as a musical critic, where I honed my skills in critical analysis and attention to detail. However, I discovered my passion for coding and decided to transition to frontend development. I have a strong enthusiasm for front-end development and enjoy bringing designs to life with clean and efficient code.
